# Find Countries

This is one of my first projects that I did when I was learning React. This version is made with TypeScript and has a better UI **_(maybe not the best)_**.

Maybe the code is confusing **_(like almost all my projects)_**, it was a project I wanted to finish as soon as possible to see how far I've progressed and learned all this time.

## How to Install and Run

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.
2. In a terminal, navigate to the folder where the application is located.
3. Install `pnpm` using the `npm install -g pnpm` command
4. Run the `pnpm install` command to install all the necessary dependencies.
5. Run the `pnpm run dev` command to start the application in development mode.
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
